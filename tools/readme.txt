Issues and workarounds
* Stuck on CM boot ani after flash
    After first install please start in recovery and do full wipe (select "wipe data/factory reset in recovery)

    If that doesnt help try "adb shell stop hciattach" Sometimes hciattach service gets stuck when starting.

Changelog:
2011-03-30
    Built from new repo branched off teamhacksung.
    overlay and libstagefrighthw (video accell) disabled so it is stable now.
    Camera is disabled (stubbed).
    data, dbdata and cache partition switched to ext4.

2011-03-02
    Added source modules for pvrsrvkm, s3c_bc and s3c_lcd to kernel sources and build them from scratch

2011-02-17
    Refreshed repo and rebuild
    initramfs built from sources instead of checked in, still far from automated build tho ;-(
2011-02-07
    Refreshed repo and rebuilt.
    Backed out codeworkx's bluetooth fix, it seems to make things worse. Added stopping and cleaning up hciattach if it fails. Now if Bluetooth start fails, just try starting it again.
    Removed overlay and copybit built from source, they cant both be installed. Use binary copybit since the ones built from the source use wrong kernel headers. Camera shows some signs of life now.
    Patched code that calls gralloc to remove usage flags not known by froyo gralloc.
    
2011-02-03 New kernel from Update1
    Refreshed repo and rebuild with latest
    added codeworkx's brcm_patchram_plus fix that should hopefully fix bluetooth initialization

    Used Nexus S GPS binaries
    Switched to init compiled from sources
    Switched to CWM 3.x (still very broken)
